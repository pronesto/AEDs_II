# AEDs_II
This repository is currently divided into eight folders, one for each class of the third module of Algorithms II. These folders are described below:

## BinSeqSearch
We study sequential and binary search in arrays.

## TreeInsertion
Algorithms to insert and search data into binary search trees, plus several simple examples of tree manipulation: count nodes, get height, etc. 

## TreeDeletion
Algorithm to remove data from a tree. We also include a linear-time implementation of union.

## RBTInsertion
Algorithms to insert and manipulate data in a Red-Black Tree

## RBTDeletion
Links to videos showing the elimination of nodes from a Red-Black tree, plus the implementation of a number of bulk operations on Red-black Trees.
