* Hash tables
  - In the last class, we saw how to produce a Set data type. The fastest
    implementations were based on red-black trees, or on the sorted array,
    sorted with quicksort.


? Would it be possible to have an implementation with faster access times than
  O(log n)? It would beat the red-black tree and the quicksort implementations.
  - Yes: we can try direct indexing, via an array.


? Could you re-implement the set with an array, using direct indexing?

#include <string.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "Set.h"
struct set_concrete {
  unsigned* array;
};
void initialize(Set* s) {
  *s = (Set)malloc(sizeof(struct set_concrete));
  (*s)->array = (unsigned*)calloc(UINT_MAX, sizeof(unsigned));
}
void insert(Set s, Key element) {
  s->array[(unsigned)element] = 1;
}
int contains(Set s, Key element) {
  unsigned index = element;
  return s->array[index];
}
void close(Set s) {
  free(s->array);
  free(s);
}


? Could you compare the access times of this implementation against the access
  times of the red-black-based implementation?
  - see timeSet.bash


? What is the size, in bytes, taken by the set? How could we check that?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
int array[UINT_MAX];
int main() {
  unsigned long size = sizeof(array);
  printf("%lu\n", size);
}


? Would this program work?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
int main() {
  int array[UINT_MAX];
  unsigned long size = sizeof(array);
  printf("%lu\n", size);
}


? How could we reduce the size of the memory that it takes to store the set?
  - Implement a bit set.


#include <string.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "Set.h"
#define WORD_SIZE  (8*sizeof(unsigned))
#define ARRAY_SIZE (UINT_MAX/WORD_SIZE)

struct set_concrete {
  unsigned* array;
};
void initialize(Set* s) {
  *s = (Set)malloc(sizeof(struct set_concrete));
  (*s)->array = (unsigned*)calloc(ARRAY_SIZE, sizeof(unsigned));
}


? How could we insert an element in the set? In other words, how could we
  modify just one bit of the set?

void insert(Set s, Key element) {
  unsigned index = element / WORD_SIZE;
  unsigned offset = element % WORD_SIZE;
  unsigned bit = 1 << offset;
  s->array[index] |= bit;
}


? Can you implement the operation that checks if some bit is in the set?

int contains(Set s, Key element) {
  unsigned index = element / WORD_SIZE;
  unsigned offset = element % WORD_SIZE;
  unsigned bit = 1 << offset;
  return s->array[index] & bit ? 1 : 0;
}
void close(Set s) {
  free(s->array);
  free(s);
}


? What's the size of the new allocation area?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
#define WORD_SIZE  (8*sizeof(unsigned))
#define ARRAY_SIZE (UINT_MAX/WORD_SIZE)
int array[ARRAY_SIZE];
int main() {
  unsigned long size = sizeof(array);
  printf("%lu\n", size);
}


? Could you compare the access times of Int-Set and Bit-Set?


? Are there larger scalar types than 'unsigned int'?
  - long
  - long long


? How can I find out the value of the upper bounds of such types?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
int main() {
  printf("%d\n", INT_MAX);
  printf("%u\n", UINT_MAX);
  printf("%lu\n", ULONG_MAX);
}


? What would happen with our BitSet, if I had tried to use ULONG_MAX as the
  size of the bit array? In other words, try:
#define ARRAY_SIZE (ULLONG_MAX/WORD_SIZE)

- That's what happens:

BitArraySet(5269,0x7fff77972310) malloc: *** mach_vm_map(size=2305843009213693952) failed (error code=3)
*** error: can't allocate region
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
Segmentation fault: 11


? How can we still deal with keys of the 'long' type?
